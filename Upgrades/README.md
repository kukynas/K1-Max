# Print setting for XY joints and additional assembly/sourcing info
Print with ASA, PA6/12, PET or any other high temp material

Layer height 0.12mm

30% infill 

Standard size has extra material only on sides so overall X length will be shorter by ~3mm (307 instead of 310) this is to stiffen the attachment of the rods inside of the joints

Extra size has material also on front face so shawing off 2mm of the front gantry holder is necessary, this extra material supports the pressure from the grab screw towards the rods 

Tolerances are really tigth to prevent potential wobble over time so if you can't fit those rods in use rasper or sand paper to shave off excess/support material from the holes 

Preinstall grab screws prior to installation of the gantry as per picture 

Extra material required: M5x5mm grab screw X 4 pcs and M3x20mm grab screw X 4 pcs, next GT2 20T 3mm hole pulleys with teeth X 2 pcs and GT2 20T 3mm hole pulleys without teeth X 2 pcs

If you plan to also upgrade X rods/tubes then these are 10x1mm size seamless stainless type, you can also use 10x1.5mm for better stiffness, XY joints are remixed with deeper hole at the top so one of the rod/tube is longer by 2mm so 385mm instead of 383mm, so 1pcs should be cut to 383mm and second to 385mm 

New print head bushings are made of 25% Carbon filled Teflon (PTFE) which should be easily sourced in your country, just let them machine it to the original size = 10x14x45mm , I'll also be experimenting with Ertalyte TX as an alternative

I had to use original Y bearings as the Y rods are too far apart causing X gantry to bind if any other sliding material is used, I will keep experimenting with other option but for now this works best

## Side Fan Raiser

Print out stl as per folder

Drill small 2mm hole as per picture under the existing heat thread

Use duct tape to seal it around

Use 5mm longer M3 screw to attach it back to the side panel

Redesign would be more elegant solution but this is quick and easy solution for now
