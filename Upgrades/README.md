# Print setting for XY joints
Print with ASA, PA6/12, PET or any other higher temp material

Layer height 0.12mm

30% infill 

Standard size has extra material only on sides so overall X length will be shorter by ~3mm (307 instead of 310)

Extra size has material also on front face so shawing off 2mm of the front gantry holder is necessary 

Preinstall grab screws prior to installation of the gantry as per picture 

Extra material required: M5x5mm grab screw X 4 pcs and M3x20mm grab screw X 4 pcs, next GT2 20T 3mm hole pulleys with teeth X 2 pcs and GT2 20T 3mm hole pulleys without teeth X 2 pcs

## Side Fan Raiser

Print out stl as per folder

Drill small 2mm hole as per picture under the existing heat thread

Use duct tape to seal it around

Use 5mm longer M3 screw to attach it back to the side panel

Redesign would be more elegant solution but this is quick and easy solution for now
