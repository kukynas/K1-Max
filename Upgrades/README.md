# Print setting for XY joints
Print with ASA, PA6/12, PET or any other higher temp material

Layer height 0.12mm

30% infill 

Standard size has extra material only on side panels so overall X length will be shorter by ~3mm (307 instead of 310)

Extra size has material also on front face so shawing off 2mm of the front gantry holder is necessary
