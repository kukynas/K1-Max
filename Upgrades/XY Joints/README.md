# Print setting for XY joints and additional assembly/sourcing info
Print with ASA, PA6/12, PET or any other high temp material

Standard size has extra material only on sides so overall X length will be shorter by 4mm (306 instead of 310) this is to support attachment of the rods inside of xy joints

Extra size has extra 2mm of material also on front face so shawing off 2mm of the front gantry holder is necessary, this extra material prevents cracking of the joints from the extra pressure made by grab screw towards the rods 

Tolerances are really tigth to prevent potential wobble over time so if you can't fit those rods in just use reamer or sand paper to shave off excess/support material from those holes 

Preinstall M5 grab screws prior to installation of the gantry

Extra material required: M5x5mm grab screw X 4 pcs and M3x20mm grab screw X 4 pcs, next GT2 20T 3mm hole pulleys with teeth X 2 pcs and GT2 20T 3mm hole pulleys without teeth X 2 pcs, 0.2mm M3 washers x 8 pcs for top and bottom of each pulley

If you plan to also upgrade X rods/tubes then I would suggest 10x1.5mm size seamless stainless steel type, just make sure you source high precision tubes with 50 micron (-0.05mm) tolerances otherwise those bushing won't slide properly and will bind, XY joints are remixed with deeper hole at the top so one of the rod/tube is longer by 2mm so 385mm instead of 383mm, but you should be fine with just 2 x 383mm rods 

New print head bushings are made of 25% Carbon filled Teflon (PTFE) which are available on the market, Graphen filled teflon would work as well, just let them machined to the original size = 10x14x45mm
